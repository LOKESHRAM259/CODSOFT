  <p><h4>PORTFOLIO WEBSITE</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>completely created my own website with html and litile bit css performed in it</li>
     </ul>

  <p><h4>OPTIMIZING AGRICULTURAL YIELD APPROACH WITH SCIKIT-LEARN </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A crop recommendation system using Scikit-learn can be designed to assist farmers in making data-driven decisions about which crops to plant based on various factors like soil type, climate, and historical crop performance. Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library in Python, offering a wide range of tools for classification, the farmers to maximize the crop yield as well as suggest the most profitable crop for the specific region</li>
        <li>The proposed model provides crop selection based on economic and environmental conditions, and benefit to maximize the crop yield that will subsequently help to meet the increasing demand for the country's food supplies. The predicts the crop yield by studying factors such as State, District, area, season. The system also helps to determine the best time to use fertilizers. The user provides a State, District, Season, Crop and Area as inputs for Production. The user provides a State, District, Season and Area as inputs for Crop Recommendation. </li>
        <li>According to the requirement, the model predicts the crop yield for a specific crop. The model also recommends the most profitable crop and suggests the right time to use the fertilizers</li>
        <li> yes the process of the project is on going</li>
     </ul>
